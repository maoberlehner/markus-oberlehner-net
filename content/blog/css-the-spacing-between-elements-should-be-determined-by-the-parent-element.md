Years of writing and maintaining CSS code and remarks by [Mark Dalgleish](https://fullstackradio.com/134) and [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1399473305086742529), along the same line, lead me to conclude that the spacing between HTML elements should be determined by their parent element in almost all cases.

```html
<ul class="nav">
  <li class="nav-item"><!-- ... --></li>
  <li class="nav-item"><!-- ... --></li>
  <!-- ... -->
<ul>

<style>
/* ‚ùå Bad */
.nav-item:not(:first-child) {
  margin-top: 1em;
}

/* üÜó Better */
.nav > * + * {
  margin-top: 1em;
}

/* ‚úÖ Best */
.nav {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1em;
}
</style>
```

I think the example above is probably the least controversial one. In the case of repeated elements, it seems like a no-brainer to put the information, about spacing between repeated elements, on the parent element.

But I'd even go one step further and say that putting the spacing information on a shared parent element in almost all situations should be preferred over putting it on the element itself.

```html
<body class="the-page">
  <header class="the-header">
    <!-- ... -->
  </header>
  <main class="the-main-area">
    <!-- ... -->
  </main>
  <footer class="the-footer">
    <!-- ... -->
  </footer>
</body>

<style>
/* ‚ùå */
.the-main-area,
.the-footer {
  margin-top: 3em;
}

/* ‚úÖ */
.the-page {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 3em;
}
</style>
```

But this is a perfect world scenario: what if the spacing between `the-header` and `the-main-area` must be different than the spacing between `the-main-area` and `the-footer`?

## Layout Components

We can make use of generic layout components to help us dealing with more complex situations more easily.

```html
<body class="the-page stack stack--xl">
  <header class="the-header">
    <!-- ... -->
  </header>
  <div class="stack stack--l">
    <main class="the-main-area">
      <!-- ... -->
    </main>
    <footer class="the-footer">
      <!-- ... -->
    </footer>
  </div>
</body>

<style>
.stack {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1em;
}

.stack--l {
  gap: 2em;
}

.stack--xl {
  gap: 3em;
}
</style>
```

Although this makes our markup more complex, I think it can be worth it in certain situations to make this trade-off.

## What Are the Advantages of Putting the Spacing on the Parent Element?

But why should we? Why should we add unnecessary wrapper `<div>`s to our HTML code? Because code written that way is much more resilient! Spacing is contextual. It depends on the larger context but also on whether a particular sibling element is currently displayed or not.

Consider the following example (written in a pseudo HTML templating language syntax):

```html
<div class="stack">
  {#if shouldShowIntro}
    <p>{intro}</p>
  {#endif}
  {#if shouldShowAd}
    <div class="ad">
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  {#endif}
  <div class="content">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Thanks to using the `stack` layout component from before, our layout works regardless of which combination of `shouldShowIntro` and `shouldShowAd` is currently at work. If we'd put the spacing onto the `ad` component, it would break if `shouldShowIntro` is false because then `ad` would be the first element.

<div>
  <hr class="c-hr">
  <a
    style="display: block; margin-top: 1em;"
    href="https://www.creative-tim.com/templates/vuejs/?partner=143346"
  >
    <img
      src="/images/q_auto,f_auto/v1532158515/blog/assets/high-quality-templates"
      alt="Screenshots of three premium Vue.js templates."
      style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"
      loading="lazy"
      width="1240"
      height="576"
    >
  </a>
  <hr class="c-hr">
</div>

## Exceptions

My rule of thumb is to default to using layout components like `stack` to determine the spacing between elements, but I'm not dogmatic about it. If I have the feeling that doing so makes the implementation significantly worse without making the system more resilient, I might choose to diverge from this rule. In the `the-page` example, I might decide to use the `stack` component as long as the spacing between all children is equal. Still, if the spacing is different between certain elements, I might choose to break the rule in favor of simpler markup.

```html
<body class="the-page">
  <header class="the-header">
    <!-- ... -->
  </header>
  <main class="the-main-area">
    <!-- ... -->
  </main>
  <footer class="the-footer">
    <!-- ... -->
  </footer>
</body>

<style>
/* ‚úÖ This is probably fine too. */
.the-main-area {
  margin-top: 3em;
}

.the-footer {
  margin-top: 2em;
}
</style>
```
