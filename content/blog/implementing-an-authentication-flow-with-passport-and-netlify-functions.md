A few weeks ago I started working on a small side project where it is a requirement to authenticate users. It was pretty clear to me that I didn't want to roll my own custom authentication flow, but I didn't want to go the cheap way and work with Netlify Identity either, because although I'm sure it's great (like any Netlify service), I want to learn new things with my side projects. So I decided to go the middle way and use the very popular [Passport Express middleware](http://www.passportjs.org/).

You can [take a look at the complete source code on GitHub](https://github.com/maoberlehner/implementing-an-authentication-flow-with-passport-and-netlify-functions) or you can [checkout the demo application hosted on Netlify](https://authentication-flow-with-passport-and-netlify-functions.netlify.com/).

## Netlify Dev

The new [Netlify Dev CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) makes it a lot easier to work with Netlify Functions in a local development environment. But there are some pitfalls you have to watch out for. Let's get started by setting up Netlify Dev to work with [our Vue CLI powered setup](https://github.com/maoberlehner/implementing-an-authentication-flow-with-passport-and-netlify-functions).

```bash
npm install --save-dev netlify-cli
```

```bash
npx netlify login
```

After we have installed the Netlify CLI as a dependency of our project and successfully logged in, we can continue configuring Netlify for our project.

## Creating a new GitHub app

We use GitHub as our authentication provider of choice. To authenticate our users with GitHub, we must first create a new GitHub app. Go to [Settings / Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click [New OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

Above you can see that we set the callback URL of our application to `â€Œ/api/auth/github/callback`. Keep in mind that you should create a separate OAuth application for your development environment, where you can set the correct authorization callback URL.

If you want to use additional OAuth-based authentication providers like Facebook or Twitter, the process is pretty similar.

## Configuring Netlify

After setting up our new GitHub OAuth application we proceed configuring Netlify for our project. First of all we have to create a new project on Netlify and set some environment variables.

      </noscript>
    </a>
  </div>
  <p class="c-content__caption">
    <small>Netlify environment variables</small>
  </p>
</div>

After that we can run `npx netlify link` in our local development environment to link our local directory to the remote Netlify project. Choose `Use current git remote url` when asked `How do you want to link this folder to a site?` (assuming you've set up your Netlify project with Git).

Now all of our remote environment variables are also available during local development. Let's create a new `lambda/config.js` file which we can use to store all of our configuration settings.

```js
// lambda/utils/config.js
// Circumvent problem with Netlify CLI.
// https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin/issues/147
exports.BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  ? 'http://localhost:8888'
  : process.env.BASE_URL;
  
exports.COOKIE_SECURE = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development';

exports.ENDPOINT = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  ? '/.netlify/functions'
  : '/api';

exports.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID;
exports.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET;

exports.SECRET = process.env.SECRET || 'SUPERSECRET';
```

### Clean Netlify Function URLs

By default, you can reach your function endpoints via URLs like `/.netlify/functions/FILE_NAME`. But luckily we can use URL rewriting to change the URL of our function endpoints.

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  functions = "lambda"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
```

Above you can see the contents of our `netlify.toml` configuration file in the root directory of our project. The `redirects` entry tells Netlify to rewrite all requests from `/api/*` to the original `/.netlify/functions/*` URL. By specifying the status code `200` we make sure the URL is rewritten **not** redirected.

What cost me a lot of time was to figure out that due to [a bug in the Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin/issues/147), **query parameters for rewritten URLs are ignored in the local development environment.** For this reason and because GitHub sends important data via a query parameter, I couldn't get the authentication process running at first. As you can see in the configuration file `lambda/utils/config.js` above, we will later change the base URL and the API endpoint based on the environment to avoid using the rewritten URL during development in order to circumvent this problem.

## Using Express with Netlify Functions

Passport is an Express middleware, so if we want to use it, we need to make our AWS Lambda-based serverless functions compatible with Express.

```bash
npm install express serverless-http
```

Luckily there is a npm package that got us covered. [serverless-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-http) makes it possible to use Express with serverless functions. We'll see how in the following chapters.

## Authentication with Passport and GitHub OAuth

Next we want to implement the core logic of our authentication flow.

```bash
npm install cookie-parser passport passport-github2 passport-jwt jsonwebtoken
```

After installing all the dependencies we need, we can finally write some real code.

```js
// lambda/utils/auth.js
const { sign } = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { Strategy: GitHubStrategy } = require('passport-github2');
const passport = require('passport');
const passportJwt = require('passport-jwt');

const {
  BASE_URL,
  ENDPOINT,
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
  SECRET,
} = require('./config');

function authJwt(email) {
  return sign({ user: { email } }, SECRET);
}

passport.use(
  new GitHubStrategy(
    {
      clientID: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
      callbackURL: `${BASE_URL}${ENDPOINT}/auth/github/callback`,
      scope: ['user:email'],
    },
    async (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
      try {
        const email = profile.emails[0].value;
        // Here you'd typically create a new or load an existing user and
        // store the bare necessary informations about the user in the JWT.
        const jwt = authJwt(email);

        return done(null, { email, jwt });
      } catch (error) {
        return done(error);
      }
    },
  ),
);

passport.use(
  new passportJwt.Strategy({
    jwtFromRequest(req) {
      if (!req.cookies) throw new Error('Missing cookie-parser middleware');
      return req.cookies.jwt;
    },
    secretOrKey: SECRET,
  },
  async ({ user: { email } }, done) => {
    try {
      // Here you'd typically load an existing user
      // and use the data to create the JWT.
      const jwt = authJwt(email);

      return done(null, { email, jwt });
    } catch (error) {
      return done(error);
    }
  }),
);
```

Above you can see how to configure and initialize Passport with the GitHub authentication strategy. Now we're ready to use the Passport middleware for our serverless authentication endpoint.

```js
// lambda/auth.js
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const express = require('express');
const passport = require('passport');
const serverless = require('serverless-http');

require('./utils/auth');

const {
  COOKIE_SECURE,
  ENDPOINT,
} = require('./utils/config');

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(passport.initialize());

const handleCallback = () => (req, res) => {
  res
    .cookie('jwt', req.user.jwt, { httpOnly: true, COOKIE_SECURE })
    .redirect('/');
};

app.get(`${ENDPOINT}/auth/github`, passport.authenticate('github', { session: false }));
app.get(
  `${ENDPOINT}/auth/github/callback`,
  passport.authenticate('github', { failureRedirect: '/', session: false }),
  handleCallback(),
);

app.get(
  `${ENDPOINT}/auth/status`,
  passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }),
  (req, res) => res.json({ email: req.user.email }),
);

module.exports.handler = serverless(app);
```

This is all the code necessary for our authentication endpoint to work. Above you can see how to use the `serverless-http` package to boot up an Express app whenever the `auth` endpoint is called. Note that this can noticeably slow down our serverless endpoint, as Express has a wide range of features that mostly cause overhead for our application.

If you now run `npm run serve` and then open `https://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/auth/github` with your browser, you will be forwarded to GitHub for authentication. Next you will be redirected to your application at `/.netlify/functions/auth/github/callback`. As you can see in the `handleCallback()` method in the code snippet above, this sets a new `jwt` cookie and redirects you back to the homepage of your app. Congratulations, you are now authenticated!

The `/.netlify/functions/auth/status` endpoint demonstrates how you can check if a user is authenticated or not. Typically you'd load a user from a database or another API endpoint based on the informations in the JWT.

## Wrapping it up

Although using this approach may not be the most performant, since we rely on Express to handle requests to our app, it is definitely a fairly convenient way to perform authentication in a serverless context. Thanks to Netlify Functions and Passport, we can roll our own authentication flow in about an hour instead of a few days.
