About a month ago I held my first talk at a major conference, the We are Developers conference 2017. I talked about Monorepos and how they can be used to manage huge codebases at an organizational level or smaller codebases like modular open source projects.

I also talk about how [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) can be used to manage multiple npm packages which are contained in a single monolithic repository.
